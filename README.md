# home-manager configuration

This repository contains my personal
[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
configuration.

It is somewhat modularized (see =./modules=).  I wouldn't recommend
anyone trying to copy anything in here (there are better, more well
thought out configurations like this [this
one](https://github.com/kenranunderscore/dotfiles)).
