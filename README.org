#+TITLE: home-manager configuration
This repository contains my personal [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] configuration.

It is somewhat modularized (see [[./modules]]).  I wouldn't recommend
anyone trying to copy anything in here (there are better, more well
thought out configurations like this [[https://github.com/kenranunderscore/dotfiles][this one]]).

As of =194db9ecc5604a9063daea91388e9bf0b302f922=, my configuration is
using flakes.

For general information on how to use =flakes= with =home-manager=,
see [[https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#ch-nix-flakes][the chapter on Nix flakes in the home-manager manual]].
* Building
To initially build the configuration, run

#+begin_src
nix build --no-link .#homeConfigurations.schneider.activationPackage
"$(nix path-info .#homeConfigurations.schneider.activationPackage)"/activate
#+end_src

This has to be done only once.  For updates, see [[Updates][Updates]].

* Updates
** =switch= to a new generation
To build a new system (_not_ the [[Building][initial]] build), run

#+begin_src
home-manager switch --flake .#schneider
#+end_src 
** update packages
To update the packages (i.e. upgrade), run
#+begin_src 
nix flake update
#+end_src
