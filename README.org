* home-manager configuration
  
  This repository contains my personal [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] configuration.

  It is somewhat modularized (see [[./modules]]).  I wouldn't recommend
  anyone trying to copy anything in here (there are better, more well
  thought out configurations like this [[https://github.com/kenranunderscore/dotfiles][this one]]).
** Activation/Hosts
   I use this configuration on both my work computer (MacOS) and
   personal computer (NixOS).

   Section 6.3 of the [[https://rycee.gitlab.io/home-manager/][home-manager manual]] describes how to achieve a
   shared config for multiple hosts.

   To active for the host I'm on, I just symlink the matching configuration to =home.nix=


   #+begin_src bash
     ln -s hosts/<hostname>.nix home.nix
   #+end_src
